        <p>There are several ways to access the data in the database.</p>
        <p><strong>By a dedicated download app</strong></p>
        <p>The app is found under “Insights >> Perovskite Database Project” in the left side menu in MaterialsZone’s system found on the link below (see instructions <a href="Interactive_graphics">here</a> on how to obtain access to the interactive graphics)</p>
        <p><a title="Link to interactive graphics" href="https://app.materials.zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link to interactive graphics</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.materials.zone/perovskite-database-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fill out the form to download and to access the interactive graphics (for new users)</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://app.materials.zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign in to download and view the interactive graphics (for existing users)</a></p>

        <p>The app provides four types of data download.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download all data in the database in the form of a .csv file</li>
            <li>Download all data associated to a specified DOI number</li>
            <li>Download data based on interactive filtering</li>
            <li>Download data based on a list of database ID-numbers</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>From the interactive graphics</strong></p>
        <p>
            For each graph generated from the interactive tools,
            the data in that graph can be downloaded as a .csv file.
        </p>

        <!--<p><strong>By directly reading data from the database</strong></p>
        <p>Connection details with read only access can be downloaded below.</p>
        <p>NOT IMPLEMENTED YET</p>
        <p>For assistance of how to use those, we refer to the example code found in the projects Github repository</p>-->
